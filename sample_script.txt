EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

A bustling coffee shop on a busy city street. People rush by outside while customers enjoy their morning coffee inside.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

SARAH, 28, sits at a small table by the window, typing on her laptop. She looks up as ALEX, 30, approaches with two cups of coffee.

ALEX
Hey, I got you your usual.

He places a large coffee in front of her.

SARAH
Thanks. You're a lifesaver. I was about to fall asleep on my keyboard.

ALEX
Another all-nighter?

SARAH
Yeah, this project is killing me. But I think I'm finally getting somewhere.

ALEX
Well, at least you have good coffee to keep you going.

SARAH
True. And good friends who bring it to me.

ALEX
That's what I'm here for. Want to grab dinner later?

SARAH
I'd love to, but I really need to finish this tonight.

ALEX
No problem. Maybe tomorrow?

SARAH
Definitely. I owe you one.
