## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with microphone access
- PDF script file with character dialogue
- HTTPS connection (required for microphone access)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for microphone access)

### Usage

#### Step 1: Upload Script
1. Click "Choose File" or drag and drop your PDF script
2. Click "Process Script" to extract dialogue and characters
3. The application will automatically identify characters and their dialogue

#### Step 2: Character Setup
1. **Record Characters**: Select characters you want to pre-record with voice effects
2. **Speak Live**: Select characters you want to speak in real-time during production
3. Click "Start Recording Session" when ready

#### Step 3: Record Character Voices
1. The application will cycle through each character you selected to record
2. For each character:
   - Read the current line displayed in the teleprompter
   - Click "Start Recording" or use speech recognition (say "done" when finished)
   - Use "Skip Line" to skip lines you don't want to record
   - Navigate with Previous/Next buttons as needed

#### Step 4: Production Mode

   - âœ… Play Recorded Audio (for pre-recorded characters)
   - âœ… Live Speaking (for real-time characters)
2. Click "Start Production"
3. The teleprompter will automatically:
   - Play recorded audio for characters you recorded
   - Wait for your live speech for characters you're speaking
   - Skip lines for characters not selected
   - Advance automatically based on speech recognition
